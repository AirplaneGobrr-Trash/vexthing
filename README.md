# Plans

- [ ] Division selector
- [ ] Make diff database per game season
- [x] Make it so you can easily change the layout of the data (Will save to game database so you can switch between games)
- [ ] Video support (for both team info and matches!)

After SSR rework:

- [x] Show matches on team page
- [ ] Faster UI travel using only one page and changing HTML
- [ ] Nav bar, quick links, favorites...
    - [ ] Nav
    - [ ] Quick links
    - [ ] Favs

(The Cata is in an array, this would make it a drop down menu, if its in an object (like the hang and auton) means that it will make checkboxes)
